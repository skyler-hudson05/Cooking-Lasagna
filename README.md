# Cooking-Lasagna
Beginner Python Project

This is a python project that utilizes functions, return values, and paramaters | It works like this: Lasagna takes 40 minutes to cook. Each layer takes 2 minutes
to prepare, so layers (your input) * 2 = prepTimeInMin and return the result. After being asked how long it's been in the oven, we subtract 40 (the origional time it 
takes to cook) from timeInOven, then return the result. Then to find how long we'eve spent cooking, we add layers and timeInOven, and return that value.
